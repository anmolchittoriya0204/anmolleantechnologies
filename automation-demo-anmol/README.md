# Sauce Demo â€“ Playwright (JavaScript) Checkout Flow

This test suite automates a **successful checkout** on the Sauce Labs demo store by:
1. Logging in as `standard_user`.
2. Selecting **3 random items** from the inventory page.
3. Verifying the cart contains those 3 items.
4. Completing the checkout with sample customer details.
5. Asserting item totals and a successful order completion message.

## Tech
- Playwright Test (JavaScript)
- HTML reporting (`playwright-report`)

```bash
# 1) Extract and enter the folder
cd automation-demo-anmol

- The test randomly chooses 3 unique items every run and validates:
  - Each item is added to the cart
  - The cart count badge equals 3
  - Sum of item prices equals the displayed **Item total** on the overview page
  - The final **Thank you** message is visible after placing the order
